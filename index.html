                <summary>When did tacos first appear in the United States?</summary>
                <p>
                    Originally, the taco appeared in the U.S. from migrants moving from Mexico to Los Angeles in the early 1900s. At the time, it was seen as low-class street food due to how inexpensive they were. When the taco came to America, it was difficult to find the authentic ingredients used in Mexico. Because of this, the tacos sold in America are not your traditional Mexican tacos. The hard-shell taco is also not authentic to Mexico. It is rumored that hard shell tacos were popularized in America since they would stay fresh significantly longer than soft tortillas.
